/**
 * Real Phase-2 implementation of assetCache.ts's `AssetCacheManager`, using
 * the browser's Cache Storage API (the same API service workers use for
 * offline assets — not `localStorage`, which is synchronous, string-only,
 * and capped at ~5-10MB, a bad fit for image blobs).
 *
 * This implementation is used by the MATCH-PRELOAD path (matchAssetPreload.ts
 * -> MatchScreen.tsx), which caches by a deck snapshot's `imageUrl` — NOT by
 * the card-library/deck-builder browsing path's `card_image_id` (see
 * buildAssetRef() above). Both are valid cache keys for the same underlying
 * printing-level art; this module treats `cacheKey` as an opaque string and
 * doesn't care which convention a given caller uses, as long as that caller
 * is consistent with itself.
 *
 * `get()` returns a `data:` URL (base64-inlined image bytes), NOT a `blob:`
 * object URL. This was a deliberate correction after `blob:` URLs broke in
 * production: this module hands the resolved URL to a caller
 * (matchAssetPreload.ts) that stores it in Zustand state to be read by React
 * far LATER — a card's `<img>` might not actually render until it's drawn or
 * played, and `CardImage.tsx` uses `loading="lazy"`, so the browser may not
 * even attempt to load it until well after this function returns. `blob:`
 * URLs are only reliably valid for immediate, synchronous use in the same
 * task that created them (or until explicitly revoked) — storing one for
 * indeterminate later use, across renders/lazy-load timing, is a known-fragile
 * pattern (observed in production: well-formed blob: URLs that 404/fail once
 * actually requested). `data:` URLs have no such lifecycle — they're inert,
 * self-contained strings, safe to store and reuse for as long as JS still
 * holds a reference, with zero cleanup/revocation required. The tradeoff is
 * ~33% larger in-memory size (base64 overhead) versus a blob reference; for
 * card-art-sized images (tens to ~150KB) this is an acceptable, worthwhile
 * trade for correctness.
 */

// Chunk size for building the base64 binary string below — well under any

/**
 * Response -> data: URL conversion via ArrayBuffer + btoa, deliberately NOT
 * `response.blob()` + `Blob.prototype.arrayBuffer()`. `Response.arrayBuffer()`
 * is read directly off the Response instead — one fewer intermediary object,
 * and it sidesteps a real cross-environment gotcha this project hit: some
 * Node/Vitest setups' `Response.prototype.blob()` returns a `Blob`-like
 * object that doesn't actually implement `.arrayBuffer()` (`TypeError:
 * blob.arrayBuffer is not a function`), even though the same `Response`'s
 * own `.arrayBuffer()` works fine. Also deliberately NOT
 * `FileReader.readAsDataURL()` — `FileReader` is browser-only (no Node
 * global), so using it here would make this function untestable outside a
 * real browser. `Response.arrayBuffer()` + `Uint8Array` + `btoa` are all
 * standard and available in both Node and every browser, so the exact same
 * code path that runs in production can run in this project's
 * Node-environment Vitest suite too.
